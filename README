MTToolbox version 4.1.2

MTToolbox is a set of binaries and libraries for working sequence data that has
been tagged with molecule tags.  Molecule tags are random k-mers that are
attached to individual molecule before PCR and sequencing.  Molecule tags are
useful in reducing PCR bias and seqeuncing error.

After individual DNA molecules are tagged with random k-mers they are PCRed and
sequenced.  By categorizing each of the sequenced reads by their molecule tags
we can correct sequencing errors and reduce PCR bias.  We reduce PCR bias
because if a molecule is preferentially PCRed we can normallize that effect by
colapsing the set of reads with matching molecule tags into one consensus
sequence.  When categorized reads are collapsed into a consensus sequence
errors introduced in the sequencing reaction can be reduced by choosing the most
represented base for each position in the set of categorized reads.

MTToolbox was specifically designed to work with reads from the Illumina MiSeq
mahcine using either single-end (SE), paired-ends (PE) with overlap, or PE
without overlap.  However, in theory it is compatable with other sequencing
technologies and protocols.
